          Hello, my name is Jonathan Obino and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer.
          <br />I work with Javascript both in the front end with frameworks and
          libraries like <strong>React</strong> and on the backend with
          frameworks like <strong>Express</strong> or <strong>Koa</strong>.
          <br />I develop mobile applications with <strong>
            React Native
          </strong>{' '}
          or with <strong>Ionic</strong> to archeive the best solution with the
          right tool for the project.
          <br />
          With nearly 5 years of experience I've worked with the latest
          technologies in software development, mastering the so-called "best
          practices" for structuring projects, developing maintanable software,
          gitflow and collaborated with amazing skilled people across different
          teams.
          <br />
          I like to stay up-to-date with the new technology and to experiment
          with them as soon they are available.
          <br />
          As you can see on my github
